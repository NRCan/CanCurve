# CanCurve
CanCurve is an open-source tool which can develop depth-damage (stage-damage) functions for use in flood loss estimation and flood risk assessments.

## Installation
- Install QGIS 3.34.5 (with Qt 5.15.13) from OSGeo4W


## Background
In Canada, there are a limited number of developed damage functions that can support flood risk assessments. Of those that are available, they are not developed using a standardized process, the underlying algorithms and data to derive them is unclear, making it a bit of a ‘black box’. Additionaly, the transferability from one region to another can be challenging.   
<p>
Previous work, in 2023 explored the Development of a Framework for the Development of Depth Damage Functions. This work resulted in a synthesis of the existing methods which are being used in Canada to develop depth damage functions. Additionally, it included some details on work done being internationally. Several limitations to existing approaches were identified and a novel and more transparent way to develop depth damage curves was proposed.
<p></p>
CanCurve focuses more on room components, with the ability to build up a building to your specifications and is not tightly coupled to building archetypes. Using this method allows for a better understanding of the contributing components to the loss, with the ability to aggregate the data via pivot tables to view items/rooms/damage estimates at various levels of aggregation. This added flexibility and transparency will provide users with a better understanding of curve data and transparency in the calculation, allowing for more informed decisions being made on applicable curves to use and possibly translate to other regions.
